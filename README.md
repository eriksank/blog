I am trying to write on the following four subjects:

#1. Epistemic delusions

The mainstream population is heavily afflicted with epistemic delusions. They are borderline epistemically insane.
However, there is one ray of hope, because there is one important set of widespread knowledge beliefs that seems to be surprisingly correct.

#2. The mathematics conundrum

Lacking another term, I have baptized a collection of math theorems: the conundrum.
It is a framework of provable impossibilities that bedevil the world of mathematics and even the wider world of knowledge.
* Carnap's diagonal lemma
* Gödel's first incompleteness theorem
* Gödel's second incompleteness theorem
* Tarski's undefinability of the truth
* Turing's halting problem
* Rice theorem
The consequences of the combination of these theorems actively seek to sabotage us on a daily basis.

#3. Bitcoin security

Most of the Bitcoin community has got it wrong on security.
What they generally believe about security is largely incorrect.
They are delusional.
By the way, that is going to cost quite a few users quite a bit of money.
In this blog section I intend to savagely debunk some of the most infuriating myths that people believe about bitcoin security.

#4. Religious Jurisprudence ("al-fiqh") is the admiralship of Islam

As a recent convert/revert, at first glance, I thought that Islam is not particularly different from other religions,
until I realized that other religions may not capable of generating a similarly large body of objective and almost mechanically-verifiable jurisprudence.
That cannot just be the consequence of having a sound epistemology because on the wrong scriptures it would not work.
Therefore, it must be feature of the scriptures themselves that effectively allow for a sound epistemology in its jurisprudence as an emergent property.
