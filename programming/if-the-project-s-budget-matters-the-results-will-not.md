#If the project's budget matters, the results will not

If we look at spectacularly successful projects such as Google Search, Gmail or Android, we could wonder how much the initial budget was to develop these applications. For example, how much did it cost to develop Google Search?

The real answer is that it does not matter in the least. Regardless of how much it cost to build the first working version of Google Search, the money has come back a thousandfold already.

Let's turn back the clock and pretend that Google Search did not exist. Let's now imagine we had dreamt up a new search algorithm and that we wanted to build Google Search. How much would a reasonable budget be? We would hit a new problem. This new algorithm has never been implemented before. So, how could we know how much to budget for it? We would not even know if this new algorithm works properly, let alone, know how long it will take to develop and test an application for it.

In other words, if the project is truly innovative, it will be sheer impossible to know what the budget will be. It will be unpredictable. Conversely, the easier it is to estimate the budget, the less innovative the project is, and the less likely that it will be novel enough to be a spectacular success.

In other words, if the budget really matters or if the budget is really predictable, it will be probably not worth spending it.

Developing a new application for internal use for just one organization only, does not make much sense. If the application is truly innovative, it would be worth publishing it as a product or as a service, and recoup investment and maintenance cost from a larger user base. It would not only be too expensive to build a Google Search engine for internal use only, if there is really a demand for it, someone else will eventually publish an alternative. This alternative will be cheaper than the internally-developed application because the development and maintenance cost will be spread over a larger user base. It will soon make the internal application obsolete.

If an application is for internal use for just one organization, it makes much more sense to locate an existing application and create a customization plan for it. If such existing application cannot be located, spinning off a startup and offering the new application to a larger market, is the way to go. In other words, there is never a case for developing new applications for just one organization.
