#Gödelian excerpts from the Tripitaka

The theorems that I prefer in math, are definitely [Gödel's incompleteness theorems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems):

First theorem:
	Any effectively generated theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic
	cannot be both consistent and complete. In particular, for any consistent, effectively
	generated formal theory that proves certain basic arithmetic truths, there
	is an arithmetical statement that is true but not provable in the theory.

Second theorem:
	For any formal effectively generated theory including basic arithmetical truths
	and also certain truths about formal provability, if the theorem includes a statement of its
	own consistency, then the theorem is inconsistent.

[Karl Popper](http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/popper_falsification.html) says something similar:

	Every "good" scientific theory is a prohibition: it forbids certain things to happen.
	The more a theory forbids, the better it is.

Gödel's theorems are theorems about mathematical theorems. To the extent that mathematical theorems can be encoded as numbers, a theorem about mathematical theorems, is just another number theory. Gödel's number theory forbids these numbers from expressing particular certainties.

The Tripitaka, on its side, is a much older, religious scripture with a similar mentality of thoroughly disclaiming false certainties, not unlike Gödel's number theory about mathematical theorems:

	There are, bhikkhus, some recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the past,
	who hold settled views about the past, and who on eighteen grounds assert various conceptual
	theorems referring to the past. And owing to what, with reference to what, do these honorable
	recluses and brahmins frame their speculations?

	There are, bhikkhus, some recluses and brahmins who are eternalists, and who on four grounds
	proclaim the self and the world to be eternal. And owing to what, with reference to what, do
	these honorable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views?

	There are, bhikkhus, some recluses and brahmins who are extensionists, and who on four grounds
	proclaim the world to be finite or infinite. And owing to what, with reference to what, do
	these honorable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views?

	There are, bhikkhus, some recluses and brahmins, who are fortuitous originationists, and who on
	two grounds proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitously. And owing to what, with
	reference to what, do these honorable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views?

	There are, bhikkhus, some recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the future, who hold
	settled views about the future, and who on forty-four grounds assert various conceptual theorems
	referring to the future. And owing to what, with reference to what, do these honorable recluses
	and brahmins frame their speculations?

	There are some brahmans & contemplatives with a doctrine & view like this: 'After death, 
	the self is exclusively happy and free from disease.' I approached them and asked them, 'Is
	it true that you have a doctrine & view like this: "After death, the self is exclusively happy
	and free from disease"?' When asked this, they replied, 'Yes.' So I asked them, 'But do you dwell
	having known or seen an exclusively happy world?' When asked this, they said, 'No.' 
	So what do you think, Potthapada — when this is the case, don't the words of those brahmans &
	contemplatives turn out to be unconvincing?" "Yes, lord. When this is the case, the words of
	those brahmans & contemplatives turn out to be unconvincing."

	Or he might say: 'Whereas some recluses and brahmins, while living on the food offered by the
	faithful, engage in wrangling argumentation, (saying to one another): "You don't understand this
	doctrine and discipline. I am the one who understands this doctrine and discipline." — "How can
	you understand this doctrine and discipline?" — "You're practising the wrong way. I'm practising
	the right way." — "I'm being consistent. You're inconsistent." — "What should have been said first
	you said last, what should have been said last you said first." — "What you took so long to think
	out has been confuted." — "Your doctrine has been refuted. You're defeated. Go, try to save your
	doctrine, or disentangle yourself now if you can" — the recluse Gotama abstains from such wrangling
	argumentation.'

	Potthapada, all those wanderers are blind and have no eyes. You alone among them have eyes. I have
	taught and declared some statements to be conjecturable, and some statements to be unconjecturable.
	And what are the statements that I have taught and declared to be unconjecturable?
	'The cosmos is eternal' I have taught and declared to be an unconjecturable statement. 'The cosmos
	is not eternal'... 'The cosmos is finite'... 'The cosmos is infinite'... 'The soul & the body are
	the same'... 'The soul is one thing and the body another'... 'After death a Tathagata exists'... 
	'After death a Tathagata does not exist'... 'After death a Tathagata both exists & does not exist'...
	'After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist' I have taught and declared these to be
	unconjecturable statements.
