#Richard Stallman's freedom is incomplete

Richard Stallman nicely repeats the gist of the GNU philosophy in his opinion blog post at [wired.com](http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/09/why-free-software-is-more-important-now-than-ever-before). In the meanwhile, we have so many new freedom problems that are not mentioned separately in the GNU philosophy and that also require attention.

The issue of software freedom is no longer confined to software itself. It is affecting all areas in life. As Marc Andreessen puts it: ["software is eating the world"](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html). Software platforms are now being used to deliver [higher education](https://www.coursera.org). Software platforms could also be used to deliver basic healthcare. Regulations are preventing that. Regulations are also preventing that people use software platforms in assisting them to give their children the necessary academic elements through home schooling. The school system is under control of governments and corporations. They do not want us to have the freedom to educate the children as we prefer. They want to keep full control over their indoctrination platform.

One key pillar of freedom is to remove the control that governments and corporations have over the money system. [Crypto-currencies](http://bitcoin.org) decentralize money and take away the ability from governments and corporations (i.e. banks) to create money, control it, confiscate it, or have other venues to abuse that power. Of course, all these battles are eventually vested in the ability to control the software that powers these decentralized user-controlled systems. I entirely underwrite the GNU manifesto. However, I just see it as a specific application of the first law:

_And thus spoke the Almighty, the lawmaking god who freed us out of slavery in Egypt: One. First Law. You shall recognize no other lawmaker but me._

If the first law gets defeated, all other commandments protecting our freedom will go out of the window too; and then we shall indeed become slaves in Egypt again.

The Christian clergy tends to de-emphasize the importance of the first law and to invent strategies like: _You must obey the law of the land._ I am just waiting for the politicians to finally force the Christian clergy to bless lesbian marriages in the name of God, the original lawmaker. That will teach the Christian clergy not to de-emphasize the first law. Since the Christian clergy do not care that we become slaves in Egypt again, what when it will be their turn? Then, we can ask the Christian clergy:

_Why do you seem to object to the law of the land only now? Pay by yourself this time, the price for preaching heresies._

This point of view may sound cynical, but sometimes that is what it takes. You can only have one master. It is not me. It is not them. It is Him, the original lawmaker. And yes, _He_ may not even exist. Does that really bother you? Do you really prefer a master that does exist? Do you really want to recognize the imposters as lawmakers?

I see the GNU copy-left approach as a fantastic game to defeat copy-right. You see, fundamentally, I do not particularly recognize any copy-right "law", since the origin of copy-right "law" is definitely not the original lawmaker. So, no, it is not a law. However, instead of openly defying this political invention, I prefer to engage in some kind of copy-left game. We can indeed defeat that kind of non-laws by exploiting their glaring contradictions. Defeating the imposters at their own game is an _auto-da-fé_: an act of faith. You see, the general rule is that no other entity can make rules that are truly universal, other than the one who originally created the universe in the first place.

It is quite simple to investigate that statement. Study any human-invented rule carefully and you will see that it is full of loopholes and contradictions. With each [counterexample](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterexample) that the bullies cannot do what the original lawmaker can do, everybody's faith in the original lawmaker is being reinforced. So, yes, using copy-left in order to defeat copy-right, is a matter of religion and therefore an act of faith.

The politicians must _not_ be allowed to universally control money, currency, and banking. Such outcome is forbidden by the general rule. That is why we must do everything they can to make the crypto-currencies such as bitcoin a success. Only the original lawmaker has the authority and the ability to exercise universal control. The politicians will not achieve their goal, and their use of force will be in vain, simply because they are not capable -- not even to save themselves from drowning -- of doing what the original lawmaker has done. Their attempts are and will always be full of errors. We must use these inevitable errors to undo and neutralize the errors in which they are contained.

Richard Stallman does not make precise statements as to whether he recognizes the politicians as lawmakers. To be an atheist -- like Richard Stallman says he is -- is no problem, as long as you do not start recognizing other lawmakers; because that is exactly the point at which the error occurs, and not earlier. The first law is not just sparing religious people from becoming slaves in Egypt. The first law also protects the freedom of atheists. It is because of the first law that the GNU manifesto holds the moral high ground. It is by defeating the false copy-right lawmaker at his own game that the GNU philosophy has succeeded.

One of the next battles with the bullies is about the crypto-currencies. The politicians and their servants are now already attacking the bitcoin exchange platforms, such as [Mount Gox](https://www.mtgox.com). The existing currency exchange platforms are clearly vulnerable, centralized systems. The politicians and their servants can easily attack them. This problem has to be corrected by thoroughly decentralizing the exchange platforms.

Some people pretend that the bullies need this control to prevent drug dealers from dealing drugs; just as if the drug dealers were not already dealing drugs. The true reason why the bullies want universal godlike control over currency are things like [FACTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act). They want to control their Egyptian slaves, wherever they happen to reside. The fact that they need to drag non-Egyptians into slavery too -- i.e. the foreign banks who must now denounce their US customers -- is obviously just a bonus; a windfall profit. Are they going to catch wealthy people with this, with large sums invested? [Obviously not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement). That is not even the purpose.

The origin of Roman "law" is a society with nobility, called _patricians_, and commoners, called _plebeians_. The Romans were amongst the first ones in history to solve a pernicuous problem. How do we make sure that the patricians are always right and the plebeians always wrong, without openly admitting this? The solution is complicated and convoluted, but it works. Even the plebeians recognized Roman "law". The Roman plebeians were excellent Egyptian slaves, until the Roman empire collapsed. A system can, of course, only contain thát many errors before the errors take over, overwhelm it, and then sink it. To an outsider, Roman "law" looks stupid and laughable. You had to be born in it, in order to actually believe and accept it. But then again, Roman "law" is not more stupid than the contemporary legal inventions that have been judisciously derived from it.

You can easily see that a law is human-invented, simply because it contains loopholes and errors. Such law must not be allowed to spread universally. Actually, it is better that it does not spread at all. To exploit its errors and to neutralize it, is therefore an _auto-da-fé_. Not only does it give us the satisfaction of performing an act of faith, but it also testifies to our allegiance to the one and only legitimate lawmaker, the original one.

Even [Odin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin) is the slave of the agreements he made. Sticking to the agreements that you freely entered, is not slavery at all. Obligations resulting from agreements are the unfreedom that enable our freedom. This is another important reason why we can never entirely be free. We can still to an important extent be free of the inventions that the bullies unilaterally try to impose on us. Their inventions will always contain enough errors for that.

The more you keep the imposters busy, the less time and resources they have to harass people with their regulations and strangulations. Indeed, the more trouble the bullies have to enforce their existing inventions, the more unlikely that they will manage to roll out yet another annoyance. So, yes, look for errors, exploit them, and please keep them struggling with their ridiculously buggy stuff. The internet was originally very free of government idiocies. Now, the politicians and their servants are encroaching again. It has to stop. Really.

What about democracy? 

I reject it. I am absolutely not bound by what other idiots believe. I am only bound by the laws of the original lawmaker and by the agreements that I freely entered. Every other unilaterally-imposed obligation, is an invitation to neutralize it in one way or another. Furthermore, [the right to govern China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_Heaven) is granted by heaven, and not by the other idiots.

I do not particularly like the use of force. Such use has to be legitimate; and it is seriously hard to do that correctly. The more the use of force reflects the stupidity of the one using it, the more I reject it. Governments, i.e. the politicians and their servants are notoriously stupid. So, yes, I do like it when they become victims at their own game.

An attack on bitcoin itself is not particularly feasible for the bullies because the bitcoin system is entirely decentralized. [Satoshi Nakamoto](http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) seems to have been in contact with higher powers who inspired him on how to carry out the bitcoin plan. The [zero-knowledge proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) extension to it, [zerocoin](http://zerocoin.org), also looks like an essential and inspired mechanism.

At the moment, it is mostly the credit card companies that adjudicate on the internet. This is imperfect. However, this situation is already substantially better than the justice system run directly by the politicians and their servants. As explained earlier, the existing, Roman-law justice system is not meant to bring justice, but to justify injustices. If justice is ever going to be administered equitably in the realm of trade and commerce, we will need to see progress in pluggable escrow and adjudication through the use of [multi-signature escrow transactions](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/pawlo/blockchaininfo_now_supports_mofn_multisignature/). Companies like Ebay may be imperfect market authorities, but they are obviously so much better than any system mismanaged directly by the bullies. Buyers and sellers in every market mismanaged directly by bullies, complain that justice is slow, expensive, incompetent, and usually also unfair. Money transmission systems with pluggable escrow and adjucation should propel more online, specialized, decentralized market authorities to the forefront and allow us to trade without the fear of bullies imposing their injustices. Not every market authority is Ebay and can buy Paypal. The other ones will have to use money transmission systems with pluggable escrow and adjucation.

The good thing about the fantastically useful areas in mathematics now powering digital commerce, is that the bullies generally do not understand them. That alone should give us another ten years of peace. The price of freedom is indeed eternal vigilance. Software freedom can be used to increase freedom everywhere. The alternative is that the lack of software freedom will continue to power the surveillance and choice-elimination system that Edward Snowden so much decried.

We need to make work of decentralizing the bitcoin exchange platforms and reinforce their pluggable escrow and adjudication mechanisms. The battle against the imposters must continue. No entity should ever establish universal rule and in that way take the place of the original lawmaker while turning all of us into Egyptian slaves.
