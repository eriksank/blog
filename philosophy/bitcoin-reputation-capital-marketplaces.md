#Bitcoin reputation capital marketplaces

Bitcoin can solve lots of problems. One pernicuous problem that bitcoin could solve too, is to tell you for how much money you can trust an unknown counterparty.

##Trust and reputation

Some people can be trusted with one million dollar. Other people cannot be trusted even with 10 cents. The maximum amount that you can trust people with, is their reputation capital. Conversely, if you are not willing to be widely known for having ripped off someone for 50 dollars, it means that your reputation capital is larger than that.

Damage to your reputation capital occurs when people publicly disclose that you have abused their trust. Disclosure of such information will inflict losses upon your reputation capital.

How can we measure reputation capital? The only way to measure the price for anything is a marketplace. If buyers are willing to buy your reputation capital for 1000 dollars, this fact establishes the value of your reputation capital. Therefore, your reputation capital is equal to the highest irrevocable bid for the key that controls your reputation capital.

##The key to your reputation

[The bitcoin system](can achieve) has demonstrated that it is possible to sign over the control of a bitcoin (or a part thereof) to someone else and to record the transaction in a distributed public ledger. A person controls a particular bitcoin because it is registered in the ledger as belonging to a public key for which he possesses the private part. This person can sign over this bitcoin by signing a transaction document in which he mentions which other public key will from now on control the bitcoin (or part thereof).

It is obvious that a bitcoin can be made to represent a reputation. The person controlling the reputation coin, is the one holding the private part of the key to which this reputation coin is registered in the distributed ledger.

##Registering a reputation coin

Anybody can produce a reputation coin. As long as there are no transactions mentioned anywhere for this reputation coin, the value of the coin is obviously zero. Therefore, it should be made easy for anybody to create a new reputation coin and to register it in the distributed ledger. The smallest bitcoin amount is on satoshi. Its value is almost zero. Therefore, we can use the bitcoin ledger itself to register reputation coins.

##Trading

Reputation-enabled marketplaces allow you to register the reputation coin to identify your account. Only you can register your reputation coin to your account, because no one else has the private part of the key controlling it. Every transaction on the marketplace automatically becomes part of your reputation history. There is no need to mention the reputation holder's real name. It is enough to be able to query the transactions made with the reputation coin and the ratings assigned by counterparties to his transactions.

##Reputation marketplace

Any reputation marketplace will automatically query the existing reputation-enabled marketplaces on behalf of prospective buyers of the reputation coin. All reputation coins are automatically listed for sale. Any prospective buyer can always make an irrevocable bid to acquire any reputation coin. The bid is valid for the period mentioned by the prospective buyer. The current holder of the reputation coin can immediately transfer his reputation to the buyer, if he is interested in selling.

##Effect on the reputation-enabled marketplaces

Reputation-enabled marketplaces automatically show the highest non-expired bid for the reputation of anybody trading in the market (buyers and sellers). When the reputation coin holder enters a transaction, each reputation-enabled marketplace notifies the bitcoin ledger of the value of a new pending transaction for the participating reputation coins. The marketplace also automatically shows what the total amount of pending transactions is for the reputation coin. Obviously, it is not advisable to start a transaction with a reputation holder whose total pending value is already larger than his reputation capital.

##Reputation that is worth money leads to trustworthiness

The higher the price for a reputation coin on the reputation marketplace, the more the holder of the coin will avoid getting bad marks that could tarnish his reputation.

For example, would the holder of a reputation coin for which he has an irrevocable bid of 1 million dollars run off with the five thousand dollars that you entrusted him with on the market?

The effect on his reputation coin would be devastating. He may even reduce the value of his reputation coin to zero dollars by doing that and therefore incur a loss of 1 million dollars by running off with just 5 000 dollars. Someone holding a reputation coin worth a lot of money will avoid at all cost inflicting damage to his counterparties in the marketplace.

##Communicating valves

With the behaviour of a trader in reputation-enabled markets affecting the value of the bids for his reputation in the reputation capital market, it becomes easy to assess what risk you can take on him. As long as the value at risk in any transaction stays substantially below the reputation capital, and the total amount of pending transactions does not exceed his reputation capital, the risk in trusting such counterparty is limited.

##Traders with insufficient reputation capital must pay upfront

If two traders with a sufficient amount of uncommitted reputation capital want to engage in a transaction, either trader can choose to pay first and accept delivery next. It does not particularly matter who makes the first step, because neither party is likely to take any risk with their reputation capital. If a trader with insufficient reputation capital wants to trade with a trader who has a sufficient amount of uncommitted reputation capital left, as a buyer he must always pay upfront before delivery. As a seller, he must always deliver upfront before payment.

It is obvious that the inferior trader will have to make the first step, and that the superior trader does not need to trust the inferior trader in any way. We can call a trader with zero reputation capital to be a _born loser_. It is clear that many reputable, reputation-enabled marketplaces will show _born losers_ the door, and refuse to open trading accounts for them. Such _born loser_ will either have to trade first in shady marketplaces where they do allow _born losers_ to open accounts, or else he will have to buy a reputation coin in reputation marketplace.

##Implications for developing countries

Traders from developing countries with bad or corrupt governance may encounter tremendous difficulty in getting anybody from a developed country or even another developing country to trade with them. For example, let's take the example of Nigeria. No trader outside Nigeria would ever give one cent of credit to any Nigerian trader, because of all the 419 -and other scams that originate from that country.

This phenomenon has pretty much turned anybody with Nigerian nationality into a _perennial born loser_. This is actually an unfair situation. The majority of Nigerian traders have never been involved in any scam whatsoever. Because of the crude assessment made by outsiders, however, they are not able to trade with people from most other countries in the world. The current situation is actually even worse than that. Nigerians do not trust other Nigerians either. Therefore, the phenomenon even leads to situations where Nigerians systematically refuse to trade with other Nigerians.

I know from personal experience that the same problem occurs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Because of the bad and corrupt governance in the country, everybody in the Congo believes that everybody else is scamming other people. Therefore, a Congolese will systematically refuse to trade with other Congolese, while outsiders from other countries generally refuse to trade with anybody in the Congo.

##Shedding the reputation of perennial born loser

The reputation capital market may allow Nigerian, Congolese and traders from other countries with a similar predicament to escape the reputation tarpit in which they are currently trapped. Some of them may really want to shed their reputation of _perennial born loser_.

Through hard work, honesty, and by consistently sticking to their end of the bargain -- all of this with morbid rigidity -- the reputation capital market should allow these traders to build up, in the sweat of their eyebrow, the reputation capital that every honest, hard worker deserves, regardless of where he happens to live.

One of the main pillars of poverty in third world countries is that honesty does not pay over there. The only way to survive in those places is by scamming, lying, stealing, embezzling, mugging, burgling, and defrauding. There is simply no way to build up reputation capital in these countries. Putting dinner on the table tonight is only possible if you have been successful at ripping someone off. It does not matter who. Just steal something quickly or else starve. Since their situation is like that, how can anybody blame them for doing exactly that? 

You do not need to have read Adam Smith's _Inquiry into the wealth of nations_ to understand why a wholesale collapse in trade empoverishes entire populations. It is no coincidence that the [poorest countries in the world](http://www.gfmag.com/component/content/article/119-economic-data/12537-the-poorest-countries-in-the-world.html#axzz2i31KCb5F) are also classified as [the worst countries to do business](http://www.doingbusiness.org). It is pretty much the same list of countries:

1. Congo-Kinshasa
2. Zimbabwe
3. Burundi
4. Liberia
5. Eritrea

It is not possible whatsoever to help or assist poor people in these countries by giving them charity or development aid. It only makes the problem worse. Their environment has conditioned these people to lie, steal, cheat, and defraud just in order to stay alive. All your charity will simply be siphoned off in scams. Therefore, without special measures, you can reasonably not even trade with them. As _perennial born losers_, these people are currently entirely beyond the reach of what can be achieved through charity, trade, or employment alone.
 
##Helping third-world countries

As a fundamentalist libertarian, I do not believe that there exists even one problem that is not the result of evils perpetrated by the politicians and their servants. I also do not believe that there is one problem that governments will not make worse. The reason why entire populations become inveterate fraudsters, is obviously because their leaders are.

In fact, even seemingly honest people regularly contribute to making the problem worse. They do this by spreading the following blasphemous heresy:

	You must obey the law of the land.

In countries like Nigeria or the Congo that means obeying to fraudsters, liars, cheats, and thieves. Uttering such blasphemous heresy is clearly in direct violation of the First Law:

	And thus spoke the Almighty, the lawmaking god who freed us out of slavery in Egypt:
	One. First Law. You shall recognize no other lawmaker but me.

Uttering the blasphemous heresy _You must obey the law of the land_ is not just a violation of the First Law. It is obviously also the main source of power for corrupt politicians and their greedy servants. It is not Hitler's concentration camp guards who were guilty of the Holocaust. It is the ones who made the preparations for this to happen, who are guilty, by uttering blasphemous heresies, and in that way incite the population to recognize other lawmakers than the original one. 

Breaking the first law by uttering such blasphemous heresies is a heinous crime against the original lawmaker. It is absolutely forbidden to call other people to obedience to anything else than to one of the existing religious scriptures, that is, the Christian Bible, the Islamic Koran, The Buddhist Tripikata, or similar. Furthermore, such obedience is only valid if it is voluntary. Otherwise, it is void.

Furthermore, all respect is based on the fear for reprisals. So is respect for the laws of the original lawmaker. You see, if someone does not like a particular religious scripture, he is obviously not bound by its laws. He is entirely free to criticize every aspect of it. If someone claims allegiance to a religious scripture, however, but at the same time pronounces blasphemous heresies against it, in that case, he opens himself to reprisals under the same laws to which he claims allegiance.

The solution to the problem of rampant crime always begins with punishing the worst crimes first. Therefore, depending on the scripture that you prefer, the appropriate, canonical, respect-instilling reprisals for horrible blasphemous heresies against the First Law is an _Act of Faith_, either through [lapidation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoning) or else with an [auto-da-fé](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-da-f%C3%A9).

##What if corrupt politicians or their servants do not like the reputation marketplace?

There is no need for any original solution to solve this particular problem. The solution exists already. Since it is obviously clear that the vermin stands to lose big time if honesty and hard work starts paying off in their country, they will do anything to put a stop to that. 

Obviously, the solution consists in using [Jim Bell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Bell) methods to address the issue. Furthmore, it is absolutely necessary to subject thoroughly to _Acts of Faith_ any individual caught publicly uttering blasphemous heresies against the solution brought to the problem.

No problem of crime can ever get solved, before first solving crimes against the First Law.

##Conclusion

Motivating your soldiers on the battlefield does not depend at all on inciting to hatred against the enemy or making great speeches to encourage your soldiers to fight hard. As a leader on the battlefield, you should never waste your time pointing your own gun at the enemy. Just look around you and try to detect as early as possible which ones of your own soldiers looks like having the intention to flee or to surrender. Make sure to solve the problem there and then. That is what makes great military commanders. Seriously, I do not believe in [waiting until dawn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_at_Dawn_Memorial).
